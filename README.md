# FloorPlan

![](Assets/Banner.jpg)

A lightweight framework for programmatic UI built for iOS using UIKit and Swift.

Its a package I wrote for my personal projects. Sharing it with the community. Although this framework is not directly inspired by SnapKit, it shares a few similarities in its usage.

## Installation
FloorPlan supports Swift Package Manager and Cocoapods. Carthage is not supported currently.

### CocoaPods

To integrate FloorPlan into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'FloorPlan'
end
```

Then, run the following command in terminal in the folder where `Podfile` is present:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate FloorPlan into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/bibintomj/FloorPlan.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```



## Usage

### Easily set constraints

```swift
import FloorPlan

view.addSubview(view1) {
    $0.top.equalToSuperView().offset(byConstant: 100)
    $0.centerX.equalToSuperView()
    $0.size.equalTo(CGSize(width: 200, height: 100)) 
}
```

### Create constraints related to other views
```swift
view2.plan.top.equalTo(view1.plan.bottom).offset(byConstant: 20)
view2.plan.horizontalEdges.equalTo([view1.plan.leading, view1.plan.trailing])
```

### Set priority
```swift
view2.bottom.equalToSuperView().offset(byConstant: 20).priority(.defaultLow)
```



## Psst. Its Animatable ðŸ˜ƒ 
No need to store your constraint references anymore. We got you.
```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.3) {
    self.view2.plan.all.height?.equalTo(100)   // modify attribute directly inside animation block.
    self.view.layoutIfNeeded()
}
```
